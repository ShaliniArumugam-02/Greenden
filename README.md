ðŸŒ¿ GreenDen - Eco-Friendly Garden Website (HTML + Tailwind CSS)
Hey everyone!
I just completed GreenDen, a modern, responsive garden-themed website built purely with HTML and Tailwind CSS â€” no JavaScript, no frameworks, just clean, semantic code and utility-first styling.

ðŸ”¹ Features:

Fully responsive layout (mobile to desktop)

Sleek, minimal design inspired by nature

Reusable Tailwind components

Hero section, product/gallery grid, and contact/footer sections

Optimized for speed and performance

ðŸ’¡ This project helped me sharpen my Tailwind CSS skills and practice building elegant UIs with just HTML and utility classes.
